### 2D City Nightscape ðŸŒ† (Computer Graphics Project)

**Description:**  
In this project, we used OpenGL to create a stunning 2D city nightscape. The scene features randomly generated buildings of various heights and styles, complete with lit windows and realistic reflections on water surfaces. The project allows for creative customization, encouraging users to add elements like bridges, streetlights, trees, and more to bring the city to life.

**Features:**
- Randomized building heights, styles, and window designs.
- Realistic lighting effects, including window glows and water reflections.
- Customizable cityscape with options for adding unique details.
